          I&apos;m Muhammad Sameer Amjad, a student from Pakistan at NUST,
          Islamabad. Been coding for about three years. I like solving problems
          with code. AI and web stuff are my thing â€” Large Language Models, deep
          learning, NEXT.js, TypeScript. Worked on many web projects and some
          apps too. I use JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Python, AWS, and a bit of SQL
          too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing close to my heart is Literature. Currently, hooked on
          pushing LLMs for 6G, dreaming up innovations there. Always learning
          more.
